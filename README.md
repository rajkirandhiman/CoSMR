# CoSMR: A Python based GUI tool to generate Graphical charts for onsite Continuous Slope Mass Rating (CoSMR) classification using strike parallelism and joint dip or plunge of intersection

CoSMR tool can be used to generate Graphical charts for onsite Continuous Slope Mass Rating (CoSMR) classification using strike parallelism and joint dip or plunge of intersection at different slope dip angles (0 to 90 degrees) for planar/wedge and toppling failure cases.

The repository was created by Raj Kiran Dhiman, Department of Geology, Panjab University, Sector 14, Chandigarh, India. 

CoSMR.py script and CoSMR.exe tool is available in this repository and can be used by following the steps below

** CoSMR.exe file can be downloaded from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lKgExMrQLHxL7XcQXThKPykSjMrDd3hx/view?usp=sharing **

Email me at dhimanrajkiran@gmail.com if you can not download the CoSMR.exe file

## Steps to Follow

Step 1. Download the file with the name CoSMR.exe and save it in your computer.

Step 2. Open file CoSMR.exe, and wait till the GUI opens. 

Step 3. Enter the slope dip value (0 to 90 degree) for which the CoSMR chart is required.

Step 4. Click for planar/wedge failure if you want to generate CoSMR chart for planar/wedge failure. Click generate CoSMR chart for Planar/wedge and wait till CoSMR chart is generated. Save the generated chart in JPEG/PNG/PDF format in your system.

Step 5. Follow step 4 for toppling failure case in the same manner.


## How to use CoSMR charts in the field 

In order to see the steps to use CoSMR charts the reader must read section 3.1 of the paper "Graphical charts for onsite Continuous Slope Mass Rating (CoSMR) classification using strike parallelism and joint dip or plunge of intersection" available on this link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013795222000448
